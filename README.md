# Overview
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes which outlines, design, develop, test, and eventually deploy information systems or software products with greater regularity, efficiency, and overall quality.

### What is the software development life cycle
A system development life cycle or SDLC is essentially a project management model. It defines different stages that are necessary to bring a project from its initial idea or conception all the way through to deployment in production and later maintenance.

There are 7 primary stages of the modern system development life cycle, and we look at each stage individually.

### Stages and Best Practices
 *  #### Planing
 The planning stage (also called the feasibility stage) is exactly what it sounds like: the phase in which developers will plan for the upcoming project.

It helps to define the problem and scope of any existing systems, as well as determine the objectives for their new systems.

By developing an effective outline for the upcoming development cycle, they'll theoretically catch problems before they affect development.

And help to secure the funding and resources they need to make their plan happen.

Perhaps most importantly, the planning stage sets the project schedule, which can be of key importance if development is for a commercial product that must be sent to market by a certain time.
