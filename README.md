# Overview
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes which outlines, design, develop, test, and eventually deploy information systems or software products with greater regularity, efficiency, and overall quality.

### What is the software development life cycle
A system development life cycle or SDLC is essentially a project management model. It defines different stages that are necessary to bring a project from its initial idea or conception all the way through to deployment in production and later maintenance.

There are 7 primary stages of the modern system development life cycle, and we look at each stage individually.

### Stages and Best Practices
 1. #### Planing
The planning stage (also called the feasibility stage) is exactly what it sounds like: the phase in which developers will plan for the upcoming project.

It helps to define the problem and scope of any existing systems, as well as determine the objectives for their new systems.

By developing an effective outline for the upcoming development cycle, they'll theoretically catch problems before they affect development.

And help to secure the funding and resources they need to make their plan happen.

Perhaps most importantly, the planning stage sets the project schedule, which can be of key importance if development is for a commercial product that must be sent to market by a certain time.

2.  #### Analysis
The analysis stage includes gathering all the specific details required for a new system as well as determining the first ideas for prototypes.

Developers may:

 -  Define any prototype system requirements
 -  Evaluate alternatives to existing prototypes
 -  Perform research and analysis to determine the needs of end-users

Furthermore, developers will often create a software requirement specification or SRS document.

This includes all the specifications for software, hardware, and network requirements for the system they plan to build. This will prevent them from overdrawing funding or resources when working at the same place as other development teams.

3.  #### Design
The design stage is a necessary precursor to the main developer stage.

Developers will first outline the details for the overall application, alongside specific aspects, such as its:

 -  User interfaces
 -  System interfaces
 -  Network and network requirements
 -  Databases

Theyâ€™ll typically turn the SRS document they created into a more logical structure that can later be implemented in a programming language. Operation, training, and maintenance plans will all be drawn up so that developers know what they need to do throughout every stage of the cycle moving forward.

Once complete, development managers will prepare a design document to be referenced throughout the next phases of the SDLC.

4.  #### Software Development Stage
The development stage is the part where developers actually write code and build the application according to the earlier design documents and outlined specifications.

This is where Static Application Security Testing or SAST tools come into play.

Product program code is built per the design document specifications. In theory, all of the prior planning and outlined should make the actual development phase relatively straightforward.

Developers will follow any coding guidelines as defined by the organization and utilize different tools such as compilers, debuggers, and interpreters.

Programming languages can include staples such as C++, PHP, and more. Developers will choose the right programming code to use based on the project specifications and requirements.

5.  #### Software Testing Stage
Building software is not the end unfortunately.

Now it must be tested to make sure that there arenâ€™t any bugs and that the end-user experience will not negatively be affected at any point.

During the testing stage, developers should be going over their software with a fine-tooth comb, noting any bugs or defects that need to be tracked, fixed, and later retested. DAST Tools can be a vital component here.

Itâ€™s important that the software overall ends up meeting the quality standards that were previously defined in the SRS document.

Depending on the skill of the developers, the complexity of the software, and the requirements for the end-user, testing can either be an extremely short phase or take a very long time.

6. #### Implementation & Integration
After testing, the overall design for the software will come together. Different modules or designs will be integrated into the primary source code through developer efforts, usually by leveraging training environments to detect further errors or defects.

The information system will be integrated into its environment and eventually installed. After passing this stage, the software is theoretically ready for market and may be provided to any end-users.

7. #### Operations & Maintenance
Once again the SDLC doesnâ€™t end when software reaches the market. Developers must now move into a maintenance mode and begin practicing any activities required to handle issues reported by end-users.

Furthermore, developers are responsible for implementing any changes that the software might need after deployment.

This can include handling residual bugs that were not able to be patched before launch or resolving new issues that crop up due to user reports. Larger systems may require longer maintenance stages compared to smaller systems.
    
Although the system development life cycle is a project management model in the broad sense, six more specific methodologies can be leveraged to achieve specific results or provide the greater SDLC with different attributes.
